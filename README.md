# BiteSpeed Backend Task - Aayush Malhotra

## Overview

This repo contains the implementation of the [backend task](https://bitespeed.notion.site/Bitespeed-Backend-Task-Identity-Reconciliation-53392ab01fe149fab989422300423199) shared via email. The following tech stack is used: <br>

1. Gin framework in Golang
2. Docker
3. `docker-compose`
4. Postgres for DB
5. JSON for configs that can be exported to Vault (or similar tools)
6. `Bash` for scripting along with `Make`

I have not worked with NodeJS in depth, hence the choice of going with Golang.
